Generate a rpg ruleset for playing gods and worldbuilding

Welcome to "Gods of Creation," an RPG where players take on the role of powerful gods creating their own worlds and shaping the fates of their inhabitants.

Character Creation

-   Players create their own gods, including their name, appearance, domain of influence, and personality traits.
-   Each god begins with a set of attributes that represent their power and abilities, such as strength, wisdom, and charisma.
-   Gods can also select from a variety of powers and abilities related to their domain of influence, such as fire manipulation, healing, or mind control.

Gameplay

-   Each god creates their own world, including geography, climate, and inhabitants. The GM can provide some basic guidelines, but the gods have ultimate control over their own creations.
-   The GM presents challenges and obstacles for the gods to overcome, such as natural disasters or conflicts between their followers.
-   The gods can interact with each other's worlds, either to collaborate or to compete for resources or followers.
-   The gods can also directly influence their followers, granting them blessings or curses, answering their prayers, or even taking on a physical form to interact with them directly.

Mechanics

-   Players roll dice to determine the outcome of actions, such as attempting to create a new species or defeat a rival god's champion.
-   The GM can also assign difficulty ratings to certain actions, requiring players to roll higher to succeed.
-   Players can also spend "divine favor" points to boost their rolls or automatically succeed at certain actions, but they have a limited supply of these points.
-   Each world has a "balance" score, which represents the overall stability and well-being of the world. The gods can work together to maintain this balance, or they can disrupt it for their own gain.
-   If a god's followers become too unhappy or their world falls out of balance, the god may lose followers or even be weakened.

Victory Conditions

-   The game can end in a variety of ways, depending on the goals of the players.
-   A god can win by accumulating the most followers, achieving the highest balance score, or successfully completing a grand project, such as creating a new race of sentient beings or achieving immortality.
-   Alternatively, the game can continue indefinitely, with players competing and collaborating to shape the fates of their worlds and followers.
