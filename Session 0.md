A: make more of a game now its an app. There is nothing that helps with progression. 
Did user testing and created persona's, gfandma, uncle, grandfather part of an expat family.

New approaches:

Cards = improving skills? 
Levels in cards.
1 card > other cards, offered by ease / effort level
4th level cards require more planning
Cards are also organized by age // critique: age brackets not always matches development of child.
Track: Peekalove >>video's can be liked = peekalove
Create Circles = groups.
Daily challenges.
Play areas. (cards are categorized based activities), add interactions with cards
Scavenger hunt
Pinpong
