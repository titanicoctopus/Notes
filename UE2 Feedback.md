Having finally complete the game, I feel I can finally give some (kinda lengthy) feedback.  
I've really enjoyed the many hours I've put into this game already.  
Even with some parts not always working correctly, or being fully implemented yet, I still felt that the game's promise of going on a journey through strange lands was wonderfully realized.  
On the other hand, I also feel like there's a few places where the game design is at odds with itself.  
The first big contradiction in the design is the generational mechanics vs player character permanence.  
On the positive side: Via the inheritance/generation system, character death isn't a game over but instead an opportunity to try something new.  
And in order to herd players towards thinking it might be a good time to swap out characters in this way, you have the Hope system, where hope losses should eventually wear a character down the longer the same character is played. When this happens, dying or retiring will allow a player to once again have a character with all their Hope Traits.  
This system is a bit cyclical with itself, but it should serve as a fine way to get players to engage with the Clan and Background unlocks, as well as Inheritance items and faction territory changes that happen in the interim.  
  
However, with all the work put into those systems, you've also designed a game where not only does the player never have to engage with those systems, but you've actually incentivized not engaging with them.  
This is driven both by mechanical design, and the player's perception of character death as only a bad thing or a failure  
Wealth transfer between generation is possible (thankfully), but tedious. The player has to travel to enough treasure chests to stash their items between generations and then travel to them again afterward to pick their wealth back up. Never changing characters in the first place saves this time spent doing a menial task.  
The other thing is you've written yourself into a corner with the achievement to complete the game on the first character rolled.  
This not only signals to the player that it's possible, but also gives them a reason to attempt it. Thus they can (and do) disregard all the work you put into the afore mentioned generational stuff  
  
I would go about rectifying this by having mandatory character retirement after they've achieved some number of large events.  
Just spitballing, this could occur on say completing your third of: Waking an elemental, interacting with a world machine, getting another clan to "Allied", clearing one of the three main Raaf temples, defeating Valker or destroying a rift stone, etc.  
You could have characters retired in this way automatically pass their inventory to the next created character with an opportunity to swap out bulky items individually for ones the new character is suppose to start with on the inventory screen of character creation.  
But I understand that you can't actually implement a system like that because of said achievement to complete the game with one character.  
As such, the only other way I immediately see to salvage clan/background unlocks and inheritance items is by having those persist between worlds (though that solution still leaves territory changes out of the picture)  
  
The other way the game seems at odds with itself is in difficulty. Particularly how certain non-bulky items undermine your attempts to make the game hard.  
In a recent patch note, you've stated that you lowered the appearance rate of healing potions and upped their value specifically in an attempt to get the game's difficulty closer to where you envision it.  
I can say not only from a long history of playing many video games, but also trading card games, that you cannot balance something being overpowered by making it rare.  
Players will still stockpile so many healing potions that health hazards become trivial to them, it will simply take longer and be more tedious to achieve.  
Player psychology says that players will make the gameplay experience worse for themselves if it makes them more powerful (The cooking system, and people's experiences with it in other posts on this board, is kind of an example of this phenomenon already existing in the game)  
Your fix doesn't actually address the root of the problem. The player can stockpile as many health potions as they want because they are a non-bulky item.  
  
Now that said, the non-bulky system is good in general I think.  
Not forcing the player to rearrange their inventory evey time they find a key or quest item is a good thing.  
Asking the player to balance the benefit of carrying all their trade items on them vs the risk of losing them all if they die is a good thing.  
Having some resources that are balanced around expiration rather than inventory size, such as food and herbs, is a good thing.  
However, certain permanent non-bulky items are just too strong. My hit list would be: Healing Potions, Refreshing Liqueur, and Serpent Spheres.  
The easy solution for those two potions is to turn them into bulky items that behave how firewood currently behaves. Maybe stacking up to 3 in a slot?  
This would put a cap on the number a player can bring with them on a journey and thus create a theoretical max HP or max times Fatigued that you can balance damage sources and Hardships around.  
Most other potions and scrolls seem "fine" as non-bulky items. If made bulky, their niche usefulness may cause a player to never value access to them over having something else in that inventory slot.  
Serpent Spheres are trickier, while allowing the player to ignore return trips makes more random world configurations manageable, I honestly don't think the safety they provide against death CAN be balanced.  
A player only needs one on their person, so limiting the carry amount won't effect their strength as a safety net like it does for potions. A player can simply keep spares in their stash, which the Serpent Sphere conveniently brings them to for easy restock.  
While I believe them to be too strong, I don't see a solution to balance them, and don't think they should be removed.  
  
I've noticed a few other things as well. Cooking doesn't do enough for how cumbersome it is, some gear or effects are too strong (Claws of the Urkat, single Form sigils in accesories, Fortune Test alerting effects on accessories, all spring to mind), and some are too weak, etc, but those are mostly small balancing issues that can be tweaked and not underlying systems issues like the above.  
All in all, I'm happy I played the game, and I'm looking forward to you getting it "content complete"
