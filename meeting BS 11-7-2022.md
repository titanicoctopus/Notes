- Feature expansions

Joris Dormans, Karel Millenaar, Hendrik Visser
Mike Corrigan, Matt Cundy, Andy Dennis, Stephen Hibbler (delayed)

- Joris research results
	- cave of Qud // players have been talking about Ue2 and
		- Developing for about 7 years
		- Built a steady engine
		- Growing player base
		- Daily players grew over 7 years
		- --> update weekly / never finish the game
				- Becomes part of a player's regular player schedule
	- kittyfox
		- Frequent reactive updates
			- no community management
				- let the community be heard
			- moonhunter = similar to ue2 launch
				- mp features didnt function well
					- kept updating / dlc
						- generates better spikes
			- Boyfriend dungeon
				- bigger splash & update
				- sales 9 months sold as many as moonhunter
- We can take the game to a better place and we think we can replicate the same results as the cases.
	- updating
	- adding content
	- 'live service'
	- Wildermyth: they do very regular update and seem to very well.
- It would make sense to emulate this. It's a different than the curren strategy. 
- We are hoping that BS could support this.

Andy: what = supporting? 

Joris: 
	- Marketing, visibility efforts: awards and events
	- financial: developing on a budget (10k) for half a year / a year

Andy: understood. On the strategy side we can do that. Financial support = difficult. BS financially, budget = tight. Titles are slipping. Need to consolidate until the end of the year.
Legal wise. Ownership is still up in the air. Probate needs still to be concluded. The correct court in Texas needs to bow over this issue. The probate needs to be published and x time to challenge this. x time before a ruling is coming. BS is not allowed to take any strategic decisions. 
What will take alot of time = Court date needs to be set first. Publishing of the docs. etc. Could be a month or longer.
joris: could it be challenged?
Andy: nobody knows. 
Money that is owed and profits are still coming in. 
Not in the position to make any recommendations to the ultimate owner.
Looking to start picking up titles at the end of october. 
Have a better idea of what's possible at the end of this week. (maybe?)
I understand what you're looking at.
That being said. There are things we can do.
We can look at discounts and sales. We already pitched the title to MS for a gamepass deal. There are changes at MS. It has been restructered. We have a contact with someone who has the role for new acquisition. We have contact every few weeks. Tried to push at launch which failed. They won't look at the title three months after launch. We are pushing to have UE2 to get a game pass deal. 
Mike is involved in getting the game on sale. There are some limitations. 2 weeks sale = 3 weeks normal price? We can potentially look at deeper discounts. 
We are limited how often we can push this. 
We can't support financially directly but we can help with these things. 

Joris: can you keep us informed?

Andy: absolutely. We get updates almost every day. We can at least keep you posted. Date of the hearing. And how long the docs need to be published etc.

Joris: humble deal?

Andy: have issues with steam

Mike: we have been requesting 10k of steam. Has to do with sales and clamping down on 3rd party sellers. Steam says no. We follow up with our account manager. If we sell more perhaps,

Joris: humble idea?

Mike: Carl offered humble a drm-free version. 

Joris: if it happens it could boost our visibility? In regarding to sales are there any plans for Games com EGX etc.

Andy: we've looked at it. has to do with staff (3 main people down). 1 person to go there is a too big of an ask. No gamescom. EGX maybe. It has to do with whats happening. 

Joris: we can also go there. You guys help us set us up with ppl etc.
There are opportunities there for us to go there. One big streamer can turn this around. Also the rewards and help submitting. 
We are doing it haphazardly. Is there a plan? We understand its difficult.

Andy: understood.

Joris: porting is not working for us. We don't know what the status is for PS. We have no idea how it plays. We get feedback from players about issues. The porters say it should work fine.  Karel even bought an xbox to see whats happening.
It might be smart to hold of launch of the PS version until we know the game is up to our standards.

Stephen: ps is not in cert yet. end of this week 2-3 weeks time submitting / book the slot. In terms of providing updates.

5 crashes in total for all purchases
11 hangings

Minority = vocal

frame rate issues aren't a big deal.
80% review score on xbox

Look into the contracts of the port teams. don't know if they are obliged to keep working. In an ideal world we would push everything out and fix it. We can only spend so much time on things. 

Joris: talked with other devs. its accepted that updates takes longer.  Would love to have known this. Want to submit ver. 1.1. 

Stephen: This is not what we usually do. We lock into a stable version and then port it. In an ideal world we would wait after the launch on steam and then hit the consoles later when the game is in a better shape.

We we pass cert we can get an update at day 1. 

Andy: It should be launched at the end of the month. If the actual issues aren't as bad. We should not delay. 

Stephen: it's the nature of the beast. This will always happen.  Look at the data. Happy to send data. 

Karel: Switch?

Stephen: waiting for the plans in august. Not in current budget. We'd love to have plans on paper. 

Joris: Is it possible to publish dlc?

Andy: send us a proposal.

Action points:
Send proposal for DLC and Switch dev.
