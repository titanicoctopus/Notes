The Wandering Village is an indie city-builder set in a post-apocalyptic world, and on the back of a giant beast called Onbu.

Wandering Village

We got our [first look](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-wandering-village-will-have-you-build-a-city-on-a-giant-turtle) at The Wandering Village’s unusual approach to the city-building genre in March last year. You’ll need to foster the development of a community on the back of Onbu, a huge creature who you’ll have to make friends with to help manage what it does. There’s the standard building construction and resource management you’d expect from any city-builder, but devs Stray Fawn say that The Wandering Village has roguelike and survival aspects to boot.


Moonbreaker

Sci-fi tabletop sim [Moonbreaker](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonbreaker) is getting two rounds of playtests on Steam in September ahead of its launch into early access, devs Unknown Worlds have revealed. These run on September 9th to 11th and again on September 16th to 18th, giving access to most of the game. You can take a look at Moonbreaker in action from its announcement at last month’s Gamescom below.
Moonbreaker is quite a departure for Unknown Worlds, known for the Subnautica series. The game’s story has been dreamt up by author Brandon Sanderson. It puts you in the spaceboots of a team of interplanetary pirates, represented by a digital team of tabletop miniatures made up of six characters led by a captain. You’ll be able to paint these yourself using some snazzy tools, in true Warhammer 40K hobbyist fashion, before pitting your team against AI, other players, and a roguelike single-player mode.

Shovelknight dig

Shovel Knight Dig is more of the classic platforming you’d expect from Yacht Club’s output. However, they’ve teamed with prolific UK-based indie dev team Nitrome, of [Bomb Chicken](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bomb-chicken) renown, for it. Dig is a roguelike, with Shovel Knight and Shield Knight having to tunnel their way down through an “ever-changing chasm of mystery”. The game’s been in development for four years, so it’s had plenty of time in the oven.

[Armed Fantasia](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armed-fantasia) is, as you might have surmised, being made by former Wild Arms devs under the banner of their new studio Wild Bunch Productions. The creator of the series, Akifumi Kaneko, is on board handling lead game design and scenario writing, and composer Michiko Naruke is back along with fellow musicians Noriyasa Agematsu and his group Elements Garden. Like Wild Arms, Armed Fantasia has a 'westernpunk' theme, and follows a group of adventurers known as Pathfinders on their journey through the wilderness. They each have their own ARM (or aether reaction maximiser) weapon to hand, and they'll be dispatching strange 'anomalies' that are ravaging the land.

[Penny Blood](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/penny-blood), meanwhile, is a gothic horror RPG set in the 1920s that's being headed up by the creator of the Shadow Hearts series' new studio Yukikaze. Shadow Hearts director Matsuzo Machida is on lead game design and scenario writing duties for this one, and artist Miyako Kato has also returned to design the characters. Original composer Yoshitaka Hirota is back, too.

Here, you'll play as private investigator Matthew Farrell as he travels the world hunting strange monsters. He himself has some supernatural abilities, and you'll be putting them to good use in Penny Blood's 'psycho sigil' battle system, which the developers say "combines traditional turn-based JRPG strategy with twitch-trigger reaction times". Probably something akin to the Mario & Luigi series of RPGs, then (or [Yakuza: Like A Dragon](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon)), I'd imagine, with some timed button presses in the mix.

Harvestella is Square Enix's chill life simulation game about farming and crystals. It was announced back in June, but a trunk of new details was released today including a lengthy video demonstration in the middle of Nintendo's Treehouse livestream at Gamescom. Watch it below, if only to read the delightful vegetable names.

Harvestella's world is kept stable by four giant crystals, and its protagonist is an amnesiac found sleeping in a field. So far, so trope-y, but the story gets a little more interesting due to Omens. Omens are armored figures believed to be responsible for the Quietus, a season that keeps getting longer during which the townspeople's crops all die, and one of them crashes to earth inside a comet at the start of the game.

The Case Of The Golden Idol is a detective game in which you explore 2D scenes of grisly murders. As you click around, you'll discover new words to add to your inventory, which you can then use to fill in your explanation of the crime. How did who get into whose room, which person was killed, and how did the murder take place?

The Case Of The Golden Idol is set in the 18th century and follows a "cursed aristocratic family", with the 12 strange deaths you're investigating spanning 40 years but all being somehow connected. It's your job to uncover the "true killers" and their motives.

One of the most traditonally _epic_ trailers from the Gamescom-themed Opening Night Live tonight was for [Atlas Fallen](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atlas-fallen). It's a new fantasy action RPG, with super powers, set in a semi-open world. In what is becoming [something of a theme](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-gta-devs-new-studio-reveals-everywhere-which-is-probably-like-either-roblox-or-second-life) for me tonight, however, the trailer doesn't really give much away about the game aside from the topline selling points. There is a tiny, teeny smattering of gameplay at the end, though. Big swords, big monsters, big magic, big sand. In another continuing theme from games revealed tonight, Atlas Fallen is out next year.

As you can see, this appears to be your post-apocalyptic world where humans are eking out a living among the ruins of their former civilisation. And sand. Lot of sand. This does provide the lady in the trailer something to surf down into battle, in a cool way, to protect a caravan travelling accross the desert. The voiceover gives a lot of talk of gods, sand, ruins, a shattered world, sand, stories, gods, and sand.

The sequel continues the story of Beatrix LeBeau, but this time is set on Rainbow Island, a new, colourful locale populated by familiar and new kinds of slimes. You're still armed with your vac, with which you can hoover up slimes, lock 'em up in laser cages, then feed 'em - I'm guessing, if it's like the first game - until they poop so you can sell that poop on the stock market. I also assume you can still cross-breed those slimes, leading to various disasters you'll have to tidy up.

Several of my favourite games are basically just choose-your-own-adventure books and Beacon Pines makes that connection more explicit. It's an adventure game where you explore environments and unlock new words, which you can then deploy during pivotal story moments when the camera pulls back to reveal the whole game takes place on the pages of a book.

The story follows small town 12-year-olds (and animal people) Luka and Rolo as they explore the mystery of an abandoned fertiliser plant at the edge of town. As you wander around the storybook dioramas, touching things you ought not and chatting to people, you'll occasionally uncover new verbs like "chill" or "hide" or "ponder". You can then deploy those words during the story moments to alter the scene that follows.

Your branching paths through the story are depicted on a literal tree, but much like a CYOA book, you can keep your fingers between the pages and hop back to previous decisions at any time. This frees the story up to go wrong in funny or creepy ways, because you can always rewind and solve your problems with a newly discovered word later. When Lauren [played the demo last year](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beacon-pines-has-a-demo-for-its-mad-libs-like-mystery-adventure), one of the words she discovered was "shit", and I very much like the idea of trying to work out where best to apply that particularly flexible word.
