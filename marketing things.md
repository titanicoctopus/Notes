The Wandering Village is an indie city-builder set in a post-apocalyptic world, and on the back of a giant beast called Onbu.

Wandering Village

We got our [first look](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-wandering-village-will-have-you-build-a-city-on-a-giant-turtle) at The Wandering Village’s unusual approach to the city-building genre in March last year. You’ll need to foster the development of a community on the back of Onbu, a huge creature who you’ll have to make friends with to help manage what it does. There’s the standard building construction and resource management you’d expect from any city-builder, but devs Stray Fawn say that The Wandering Village has roguelike and survival aspects to boot.


Moonbreaker

Sci-fi tabletop sim [Moonbreaker](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonbreaker) is getting two rounds of playtests on Steam in September ahead of its launch into early access, devs Unknown Worlds have revealed. These run on September 9th to 11th and again on September 16th to 18th, giving access to most of the game. You can take a look at Moonbreaker in action from its announcement at last month’s Gamescom below.
Moonbreaker is quite a departure for Unknown Worlds, known for the Subnautica series. The game’s story has been dreamt up by author Brandon Sanderson. It puts you in the spaceboots of a team of interplanetary pirates, represented by a digital team of tabletop miniatures made up of six characters led by a captain. You’ll be able to paint these yourself using some snazzy tools, in true Warhammer 40K hobbyist fashion, before pitting your team against AI, other players, and a roguelike single-player mode.
