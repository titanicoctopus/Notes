The Ur Ma are a culture from people who are lost and have adopted the true form path.
The true form path is a practice where folk are physically and mentally preparing themselves to transform into a new better shape which is able to fight the incursions of the empire. 

Trading with the Ur Ma|| by Zerel of Jabar

The Ur Ma are a peculiar bunch of folk. They tend to settle deep within marshlands and swamps in small communities. They keep to themselves and don't like trespassers within their hunting grounds. But there are occasions that some are tolerant to outsiders and even are interested in trade. Now these folk are fantastic craftsman and are able to make sturdy and durable gear.
