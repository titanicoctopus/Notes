[[Lore]]

The moons of the world have been guiding the fates of folk from the beginning of time. When each moon rises in the sky it heralds in a new time in the year. 

Azure
Under the light of the Azure moon the world regains its strength. Its blue radiance brings back vitality and inspiration. The world becomes warmer as the radiance of the Azure let the Suns heat linger longer in the night. 

Folk come outdoors and begin te tend the field again. Crops are being sown and plans are set in motion.

Mirror
As the crystal moon Mirror climbs the sky, the world is in a dual state of contemplation and movement. All things seem possible which can stop an initiative dead in its tracks. While other initiatives keep moving jumping to one opportunity to the next, seemingly lost in a labyrinth of possibilities.

Folk tend to spend their time outdoors. Goods are crafted. Raids are common at this time.

Fortune
When the twin moons Fortune appear in the sky, the time to reap what has been sown begins. The world flowers and matures under the white and red Fortune. 

Folk harvest the fields and preserve the foods for the coming times. Conflict is uncommon as all folk are necessary to harvest as much as possible.

Astral
When Mirror has sunk below the horizon, the time of Astral has come. The guiding light of the moons is gone and only the myriad of stars lights the dark night.   Endeavors has paid off in one way or another. And the world comes into a state of rest. It cools as there is no radiance to warm the world. 

Folk tend to stay indoors. They enjoy the fruit of their labors and focus their efforts on creative pursuits.

Lunar Calendar

An illuminated calendar lies neatly folded between some books. When folded out four distinct periods, segmented in in 64 parts, is layed out. The four periods of the year are labeled as Azure Moon, Mirror Moon, Fortune Moon and Starry Nights. Above each period a night sky is depicted with their prominent celestial features.||[next]

In the first period the moon Azure dominates the night sky. The moon is depicted as a clear blue sickle surrounded by a garland of vibrant green.||[next]

The night sky in the second period is defined by the appearance of Mirror. This moon is depicted as a set of concentric angular shapes.  Stylized figures, drawn in a variety of states seem to fall out of the moon. Some of these figures seem to hang on to nearby stars.||[next]

The twin moons of Fortune rule the sky in the third period. They are depicted as a white disc with a smaller overlapping red disc. Surrounding the moons various worldly things are drawn in white and red. On the far side of the sky a star with a streaky tail tries to crawl to the horizon.||[next]

Starry Nights, the last period of the year, has no moon. Sparkling stars are drawn over a tranquil landscape. At the edge of the sky a star with a dark core is depicted very far from other stars.
