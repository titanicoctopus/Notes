[[==Project UNEXPLORED 2==]]
[[UE2 creatures]]

The leathery small creatures scurry in the dark scavenging and hunting for food. They are usually docile during the day and hole themselves up in dark confined spaces like caves and holes.

When roused the beasts are very agressive and will swarm anything that moves.

When dealing with them make sure you don't get caught in the middle of their swarm. If pressed into a confrontation it's better to swing with your weapon to hit several of them.
