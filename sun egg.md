The Sun Egg
an ancient story

Elder Eclipse, in their need to see all that there is to see, one day climbed the highest mountain in the world. From there they could see everything under the sky. The could see folk, the beasts and the spirits work in unison to build and shape the world. They were content to see them all doing their part in Raaf's plan.[next]When Eclipse cast their eyes above the horizon they could see the familiar stars, clouds and sun. They were content that that they were lighting up the sky as they should be.[next]But then they something new. Just above the horizon they saw a new star. This one had a long tail and a bushy beard which flowed with the wind. It was gently bobbing up an down the horizon. [next]Eclipse didn't notice this star before. They were curious what that peculiar star was doing just below the horizon. So they jumped on a cloud to see what make the star bob. Still they couldn't see and they climbed upon another cloud and another and another. And still the strange star dipped so deep below the horizon Eclipse couldn't see what make it bounce back.[next]Then they got an idea. The sun was probably the highest thing in the sky and from there they probably could see what was behind the horizon! With a few graceful jumps from one cloud to another they jumped onto the sun.[next]But this was a mistake. The golden disk that was the sun was hot to the touch and very slippery. Eclipse slipped and fell. They slid off the disk breaking bits and pieces of the sun as Eclipse tried to hold on to something to stop their fall.[next] Eclipse plummeted to the ground followed by a trail of golden pieces of the sun. Where the pieces fell, folk would find smooth golden spheres which were warm to the touch offering a boon to those who would travel in cold places.

Everfrost
an ancient story

When the Elders convened in the First Valley. Elder Mercy chose to be  concerned with the well-being of us folk. But they didn't know what the nature was of folk. Who we were, what we were about.
They sat on a rock overlooking the Valley and asked each Elder to discuss the matter.
They talked with Elder Eclipse, who explained in detail what folk looked like and what they did.
They talked with Elder Dai-Varo, who talked about folk's inner drive, passions and instincts.
They talked with Elder Haibor, who said nothing.
Elder Mercy didn't understand why Elder Haibor kept silent. They began to ask more questions, but their came no aswers. Then Elder Haibor said:" What seperates us from them should be removed if you truly want to take care of them."

Then Elder Mercy stood up from the rock, reached out into her hart and smashed it to bits. Her immortal heart shattered in a million of tiny pieces. Each shard a splinter of eternal cold which was blown away with the wind. 
Relieved Elder Mercy put what remained of their hart back, a warm and mortal one.

Quickly Moobak ran away and continued their pursuit of the Impala.[NEXT]The story concludes with a scene where Moobak is sitting at a camp fire, eating roasted meat and holding a glowing stone.
