On Guardian Spirits||Snorri II, 132nd scholar[next]As chieftains and kings rule over folk, in a way Guardians rule over the spirits in a specific region. From Marang sources and our own experiences these special orders of spirits have the ability to control spirits and elements under their purview. They use these abilities to perform a specific task or reach a specific goal proclaimed by what we think would be Raaf or the Prime Elemental. These tasks range from clearing a region of certain unwanted features (e.g. volatile volcanoes) to shaping building blocks for future projects (e.g. ores, crystals etc.)

Rituals of Vuur||This text is a compilation of notes, anecdotes, songs and stories written down by a variety of authors of the years. The earliest entries are barely legible as the text has faded or is damaged. As you flip through the texts some excerpts peak your interest.[next]Epitaphs||Guardian Vuur|Flametongue|Forgemaster| Flameshaper[next]Observations by Mystic El-Mazuk.||For weeks I've been studying the Guardian Vuur. They don't speak and barely acknowledge my presence. I think they can barely percieve me. Yet as I tell stories and sing songs to them they hang around. I have thrown in some cold and hot items in their sacrificial pool and they seem to react to it, emulating As-Ubsa. I wonder what would happen if I threw in a sun egg.[next] Court of Vuur||An elaborate illustration of an underground area surrounded by flames. The focal point of the composition is a circular natural feature with bubbling lava where a small figure throws in a small glowing egg and a snowflake. A flaming mask looks at the small figure from above.

As-Ubsa||In the Year of Crossed Twigs our lands became unbearably hot. The land itself began to heat as it became a stove. Vuur, guardian of the lands, was displeased with our meddling. The mystic circle sent As-Ubsa, coldest of the eleven, to the Court of Vuur to make amends.||With a gift of Mercy’s cold heart, they braved fiery dangers to reach the throne of Vuur. There they cast the heart into the sacrificial pool. Vuur appeared before As-Ubsa and they began to plead for Vuur’s wrath to abate.||Their words moved Vuur and they let the flames of their anger grow cold. With the guidance of Vuur, As-Ubsa returned to the surface and saw that the lands were normal once again. 

Flame River Court
A legendary place where the Guardian Vuur holds court.

"Remember that old story of As-Ubsa? The other day a traveller mentioned that they visited The Flame River Court in [IN REGION]."
As-Ubsa

"The Flame River Court from the old stories is real. [AT A LOCATION] is a periolous place to visit. It's dangerously hot there, as rivers of motlen rock flow freely."
Flame River Court

"A long time ago, I tried to have an audience with Vuur. But inside the Flame River Court, I encountered a flame spirit which burnt my clothes and melted my weapons!"

Dangerous Flame Spirit

"When I was in training, I studied the book Rituals of Vuur.  To me the texts suggests that Vuur only will see you if you sacrifice an offering of either fire or ice."

Vuur Offerings

"Our stories tell that the Guardian Vuur has protected us from great heat and cold in the past."
A Vuur Blessing

"In the past we managed to persuade the Guardian Vuur to protect us from a horde of fiery beasts."
A Vuur Blessing

"These days a Sun Egg is a rare find. I recall vaguely it's a prized offering for certain Guardian Spirits."
Something about a Sun Egg

"I never seen an Everfrost in real life. But a friend of mine is looking for one as an offering to the Guardian Vuur."
Something about an Everfrost

"Before the Flaming River Court became dangerous, I visited it often hoping to find the Guardian Vuur. I never found them, but I did find an ancient ruin in the caves."
A ruin in the Flame River Court

FE1043-2, Conclusions||translated by Egge, 1962th Scholar[next]The author prefaces the text with a detailed description of the state of the original text. The slate the text was found on was severly damaged, as it was partially melted by extreme heat.[next]...as their power is not totally useless as was previously reported. My recommendation to the Elementor is to allocate more resources to look further in the elemental smelting process Vuur is capable of. I suspect from what we can learn from the spirit we can make the process of Magentol more efficient. For now we will close down the observation post until further orders...

"For some reason I have to tell you about a vision I've seen in the fire. A fiery thing burned a robed figure. Then it took their mask and went into a cave of molten fire. Strange isn't it? Is it a sign of our end?"
A fiery vision


"I vaguely remember a story where the Guardian Vuur had killed their ancient tormentor and kept their mask as their trophy."
An old story about Vuur

The Marang Flame Mask can be found [AT A LOCATION].
Flame Mask

"I have to tell you that the Flame Mask can be found [AT A LOCATION]. Why did I tell you this? And what is a Flame Mask?"

De guardian heet Vuur
De plek waar deze woont heet de Flame River Court (Courts zouden een naam kunnen zijn voor plekken waar guardians zich ophouden.)

Boeken
info.onguardians - een boek die de basis verteld over guardian spirits voor in de haven bieb
info.asubsa - een loot boek die hint naar het gebruik van everfrost en het effect
info.ritualsofvuur - een loot boek die hint naar de aard van Vuur (guardian spirit) en het gebruik van de sun egg en everfrost.
info.marangvuur - een loot boek die hint naar wat de marang gedaan hebben met Vuur in het verleden.

Rumors
info.flamerivercourt - rumors die hinten naar de plek waar Vuur zich schuilt
info.flamemask - entries die we de flame mask koppelt aan Vuur

Fortune test
test.vuur - hier staat de fortune test met vuur. Ik heb het zo geschreven dat praktisch alle entries gebruikt kunnen worden in beide cases (cold en hot). Het enige die het kadert als een cold / hot case zijn de entries test.vuur.line.cold en test.vuur.line.hot
De fortunes die erin zitten zijn: succes, failure, rareopportunity, gloom, pushyourluck and takeyourtime. Ik laat aan jou over wat de exacte mix moet zijn. Maar het mag redelijk moeilijk zijn. (wayfarer heeft 2/3 free draws)

A magic heat radiates from this crater. Markings indicate this is a place of worship. You suspect that worhsippers burn sacrifices in the nearby smaller crater.

The heat from this crater feels cooler than you would expect. The contained magma bubbles in a steady rythm, releasing some cinders. These cinders flow around the crater in a peculiar steady pattern.
As you follow the pattern with your eyes in your mind the name Vuur begins to form. ||You conclude this crater is the throne of a spirit called Vuur and the smaller one is their altar!
