Flame Elemental Legend

Before the time of the Answar, before the empire cast its shadow across the world, there was an age where the peoples known as the Marang lived. In that age there was a time that these people mastered all the elements but flame. The land was cold and warm on just a whim. This made working the land difficult and the people were starving. The Marang could not stand for this and vowed to change this.

  
Through their devices and insights they gleaned that the Flame Tyrant Kuulvak held the secrets of flame. This gigantic creature roamed this land, where it would call upon the fires from the sun and call in the cold of a winter's sky on a whim. This would cause heat and cold to travel to other lands.

  
The Marang devised a plot to wrest the secrets from the wretched creature. They built a creature of bronze called Bir. Its bronze body was unique as it was made to be resilient to the hottest heat and the coldest cold. They had five eyes and three arms and wielded fearsome weapons which could destroy anything folk made with one strike. 

  
On the plains of [location] Bir challenged Kuulvak where they fought for 64 days and 64 nights. None could gain the upper hand. Then Bir charged forward to try to force an opening, but Kuulvak anticipated this and threw Bir high in the sky and snatched them up with their maw and swallowed them whole. Exhausted, Kuulvak laid down their head and slept. With every passing day kuulvaks fire dimmed. The random heat and cold spells abated and Kuulvak never woke again.

In the distant Marang lands a master of Flame was crowned and no Marang was hungry ever again.

  

Legend of the Bronze Hero

  In the lost age folk and spirits were at war. Whole swaths of lands were razed in the conflict. At [location] two great armies clashed, threatening to destroy our ancestors who were caught in between. Then a hero made of bronze rose up in the defense of our ancestors. They destroyed the folk army with the scorching heat of the day and froze the spirit army with the cold of a winter's night. The Bronze Hero was lauded as the champion of our people and they feasted for a whole season. At the season’s end they met with with a close friend, a wanderer from a distant land and a distant past. The Bronze Hero died the next day and the wanderer was nowhere to be found. Our people buried the Hero with our hallowed ancestors.
